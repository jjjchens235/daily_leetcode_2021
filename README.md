## Purpose
My goal is to become a data engineer. Most companies will ask prospective DE's data structure and algorithim questions.
As such, I plan to study leetcode around 1.5 hrs each weekday.
To keep myself accountable, I will be pushing each day to this github repo with whatever progress I have made.
