### Goal
Goal is to prepare for data engineering interviews at top tech companies. For DE, the most common data structures are going to be strings, arrays, and hash tables.

I will be going through the following list of string problems:
- [Leetcode Curated list](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/879/)
- [Yangshun](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/algorithms/string/)

#### Template
For each question, I will provide the following:

1. Logic
	- df
2. Experience
	- df
3. Takeaways
	- df

#### Cracking the code interview
I want to follow the following routine for each problem, taken from Cracking the Code
1. Listen - pay very close attention to the description
2. Try (draw) an example
	1. make sure it's not too small, and not an edge case
3. Implement Brute force
4. Optimize using BUD
	1. bottleneck
	2. unnecessary work
	3. duplicated work
5. walk through the optimal solution in detail before coding
6. Implement
7. Test
	1. conceptual test
	2. unusual or non-standard code
	3. hot spots 
			1. arithmetic
			2. null
	4. small test cases
	5. special cases

#### 334 Reverse String
1. Logic
	- Not using any native methods, I did a swap
2. Experience
	- Came up with the swap solution pretty quickly, I tried testing with pure strings, and I got an string immutable error. 
3. Takeaways
	- Need to read the problem more carefully (first step of CtC), didn't realize the argument was a list of chars and not a string
	- Inadvertedly, I re-discovered that you can't swap characters in a string due to immutability

#### 387 First Unique Char in a string
1. Logic
	- df
2. Experience
	- df
3. Takeaways
	- df
